# World Countries Word Game
I created this simple word game in May 2005 using Java for an AP computer programming course in high school. The game is formatted as a Java applet. It can be viewed by running the HTML file in the appletviewer that comes with the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java Development Kit</a> (appletviewer.exe in the bin folder).

<b>Instructions:</b><br>
The player is given a series of blank spaces, each corresponding to a letter, that spell out the name of a country (as of 2005). The player must choose one letter at a time in attempting to fill in the spaces. Each correct guess will reveal any of the chosen letter in the country name, while an incorrect answer will draw a portion of a stick figure. If the player makes too many incorrect guesses and the stick figure is completed, the game is over.

<b>Difficulty Levels:</b><br>
The player may choose between easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels. To switch between them, select a level, then select "new game" to refresh the screen. On easy, the player is provided both the country's flag and map. On medium, only the flag is displayed. On hard, the player must guess without the flag or map clues.
